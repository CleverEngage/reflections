When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I will use a remote repository when I want to contribute with others, whether
    the project is public or private. Also, I will use it when I want to make
    a personal private repository and access it from different systems or locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because:
    - Pulling the changes manually give me freedom to choose the right time that suit
    my works and not effect it.
    - I will not be interrupted in the middle of my coding, eg. to solve conflicts.
    - if there are a lot of changes, I will not bother by them. I can wait, then I may 
    pull a dozen of changes (commits) in one git command.
    - let me focus more in coding.
