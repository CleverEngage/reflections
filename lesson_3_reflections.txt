When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I will use a remote repository when I want to contribute with others, whether
    the project is public or private. Also, I will use it when I want to make
    a personal private repository and access it from different systems or locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because:
    - Pulling the changes manually give me freedom to choose the right time that suit
    my works and not effect it.
    - I will not be interrupted in the middle of my coding, eg. to solve conflicts.
    - if there are a lot of changes, I will not bother by them. I can wait, then I may 
    pull a dozen of changes (commits) in one git command.
    - let me focus more in coding.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Branches are available in any repository (local, remote). I will use it when
    I want to do any changes to the repository without effecting  files in original
    branch.

    - Clone is a copy of existing repository. I will use it to copy a local repository
    to different directory or copy remote repository to local machine. And if I copy 
    a remote repository by git clone command, the git will set the remote URL for 
    me as origin.

    - Forks are a copy of existing repository in the GitHub from another user to my
    GitHub account. I will use it when I do not have permission to push changes to 
    other GitHub user repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    When latest of remote stored locally, Git can know if local repository 
    is up-to-date or if there are new commits in the master branch, and
    use it to make a merge either by fast-forward or by making new commit.
